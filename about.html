        <p>This website is a pet project that I work on when I am bored. There is always a list of books I am reading, have read, love and want. I have had friends recommend books and give me books. <br> If you have any suggestions please feel free to put them on the suggestions page, if you don't feel comfortable posting publicly, you can contact me through the contact page. </p>

        <p>I have a dog named Sampson, who is the love of my life. He is a 35 lbs bundle of love. <br>I have a Bachelor's degree from the <a href="http://www.uky.edu/UKHome/">Univeristy of Kentucky</a> in <a href="http://ci.uky.edu/sis/ict">Information Communication Technology</a>, a fancy way of saying IT. I am currently working toward my Master's degree in Cybersecurity through <a href="http://www.utica.edu/">Utica College</a>.<br>I have had a number of jobs throughout my schooling career but recently joined the FDM group as a Cybersecurity consultant.</p>
